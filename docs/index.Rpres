Data Introduction
========================================================

<center>
* <small>The data in this project are of 8 driving simulations for 66 individuals ranging from 3,000 to 30,000 observations per simulation.</small>
* <small>Every simulation observation contains likelihood scores for 8 facial expressions recorded at a fixed interval of .03 seconds.</small>
* <small>Stimuli data which records targetted events introduced into each simulation and basic demographic data on each subject are also available.</small>
* <small>There are over 6.7 million observations in the entire dataset spread accross 777 files.</small>
</center>

<center>**T001-001.xlsx (Subject 01, Simulation 01)**<br>

</center>

<br> 

<center>
* <small>The data set used in this project was originally collected and analyzed in **[Dissecting Driver Behaviors Under Cognitive, Emotional, Sensorimotor, and Mixed Stressors](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep25651)**, Scientific Reports 6, Article number: 25651 (2016).</small>
</center>





Data Extraction
========================================================

<center>
* <small>**[Python scripts](https://github.com/JestonBlu/Driving/tree/master/Files)** were used to extract and combine the 509 driving simulation files and 267 stimuli files into combined data sets.</small>
* <small>The subject-simulation identifier was the name of each file. A column labeled ID was created based on the file name to identify the original data set.</small>
</center>

<center>**Sample of data-faces.csv**

```{r a1, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
## Import faces
faces = read.csv("../Files/data-faces.csv", nrows = 10)

## Apply Rounding for better visual
faces[,2:10] = apply(faces[,2:10], 2, function(x) round(x, 4))

## Adjust column name
colnames(faces)[1] = "Frame"

## Print table
kable(head(faces))
```

</center>

<center>**Sample of data-stimuli.csv**

```{r a2, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
## Import stimuli
stimuli = read.csv("../Files/data-stimuli.csv")

## Adjust column names
colnames(stimuli) = c("Start", "End", "Event.Switch", "Event.Type", "Event", "ID")

## Print table
kable(head(stimuli), split.table=Inf)

rm(list = ls())
```

</center>


<center>
<left><div class="note">
  - <small>NOTE: 2 simulation files started on different rows than the rest of the 507 files and had to be manually corrected.</small>
    - <small>T034-005.xlsx: header starts on row 8 </small>
    - <small>T009-006.xlsx: header starts on row 10 </small>
</div>
</center>


Data Preparation
========================================================

<center>

* <small>The event data captured the starting and ending times of events only.</small>
* <small>A loop function was written to go through each record and compare time between the simulation and the starting/ending time of the event.</small>
* <small>If the simulation time fell within the starting/ending time interval in the event data, then all of the records in the time interval were coded with that event (ie: **Texting**)</small>
* <small>All observations outside of the event time interval were coded as **No Event**.</small>

<br>

**Sample of Cleaned Data Showing an Event Transition**

```{r a3, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
## Import combined data
load("../R-Data/faces.rda")

## Subset the data to show a texting event switch
faces = subset(faces, ID == 'T001-007' & Time >= 80.9 & Time < 81.1)

## Apply rounding for better visual
faces$Time = round(faces$Time, 3)
faces[, 11:18] = apply(X = faces[, 11:18], MARGIN = 2, FUN = function(x) round(x, 4))
faces = faces[, -1]

## Hack to hide row names
row.names(faces) = NULL

## Print table
kable(faces, split.table = Inf)

```

<br>

<left><div class="note">
  - <small>NOTE: The average texting event lasted 2.5 minutes, but we dont really know what occurred during the event time interval. Was there one long texting action or was the event made up of a series of sending and receiving texts?</small>
</div></left>

</center>


Project Management
========================================================

<br>

**Reproducible Research**

* <small>Code, plots, and this presentation are organized and hosted in a github repository.</small>
* <small>The main page includes steps to reproduce the data set and models</small>
* <small>The data is too large to be hosted and would need to be retrieved elsewhere</small>
